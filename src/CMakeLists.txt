# This is a catkin workspace toplevel CMakeLists.
# Some copies of this repository shipped a one-line file containing only:
#   /opt/ros/<distro>/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake
# which is treated as plain text by CMake and causes a parse error.
#
# The correct toplevel content is to include catkin's toplevel.cmake.
